version 0.001; 2012-02-01

  * bugfix: properly avoid duff constant folding with pos() code on Perl
    5.9.4 and above, which only occurred when warnings were disabled in
    the context of the pos() expression

  * bugfix: also influence rindex, as $[ does

  * bugfix: require bugfixed version of Lexical::SealRequireHints (for
    compatibility with early-loaded warnings.pm) and invoke it earlier
    to make sure it takes effect in time

  * update documentation for $[ changes in Perl 5.15.3 and 5.15.5

  * in Build.PL, declare incompatibility with pre-0.19
    B::Hooks::OP::Check, which doesn't play nicely around op check hooking

  * convert .cvsignore to .gitignore

version 0.000; 2011-09-07
