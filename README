NAME

String::Base - string index offseting

DESCRIPTION

This module implements automatic offsetting of string indices.  In normal
Perl, the first character of a string has index 0, the second character 
has index 1, and so on.  This module allows string indexes to start at
some other value.  Most commonly it is used to give the first character 
of a string the index 1 (and the second 2, and so on), to imitate the
indexing behaviour of FORTRAN and many other languages.  It is usually
considered poor style to do this.

The string index offset is controlled at compile time, in a
lexically-scoped manner.  Each block of code, therefore, is subject to
a fixed offset.  It is expected that the affected code is written with
knowledge of what that offset is.
